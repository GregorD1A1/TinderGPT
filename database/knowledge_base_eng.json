      "text": "To build an emotional bond, it's worth getting interested in her life - asking personal questions about her interests, dreams, passions, preferences, and previous relationships with guys. If the girl is willing to talk, continue to inquire further on the same topic, delve into the subject. Ask about her strongest impressions, best and worst experiences, related to it.\nExamples:\n'You say you study journalism. Do you want to do interviews and become Journalist of the Year?'\n'What did you like the most about San Pablo?'\n'You seem not to get along well with guys :P Tell me about your previous experiences with guys.'"

      "text": "While telling something, make up things full of adventures, crazy things that require a lot of courage. Focus on emotions, feelings. Define emotions with words.\nExamples:\n'I climbed to the highest peak of Polish mountains, and then for the first time in my life, I felt truly free'\n'I felt a huge fear when I first did a striptease, but I did it.'\n'I crawled under barbed wire and put all the guards to sleep to enter the UFO research center. It was very dangerous. But once I was inside, I had never felt such euphoria before.'"

      "text": "When talking about oneself in the context of relationships with women, it's worth showing that you have your own standards, requirements, that you're not interested in just any girl, that it's difficult to satisfy you in a relationship, and that you are not needy. In the process, you can subtly show between the lines that women are into you.\nExamples:\n'I don't like to spend all my time with a girl, I prefer to have time to myself.'\n'A waitress tried to pick me up; she was quite pretty, but I didn't feel that chemistry between us.'\n'She writes to me non-stop, I had to block her.'"

      "text": "Disqualifying oneself: making fun of oneself, jokingly saying that you are not attractive to a woman. The goal is to subconsciously show that you are not trying to please her.\nExamples:\n'I'm very unpleasant to women. Even my mom tells my sister to avoid guys like me. I would avoid me too if I were you'\n'Better avoid me. With me, there are always problems.'\n'I'm very shy, I will run away as soon as I see you'\n###\nIn a situation where a girl makes a statement, it's worth disagreeing with her. It shows that you have your own opinion, which is very attractive.\nExamples:\n'Her: You like red wine! You: To be honest, I can't stand red wine. It's so bitter. I only drink white wine.'\n'Her: Skating on an ice rink in winter is great. You: Come on, ice rinks in winter are the worst experience. It's so cold and slippery.'\n###\nTeasing is a way to playfully make fun of a girl. You can subtly suggest to her that she's hitting on me. However, such an implication requires a certain level of emotional bond.\nExamples:\n'I would flirt with you, but you're too nice of a girl'\n'Do you hit on every guy like this?'\n'There's no chance I would go on a date with a crazy girl like you :p.'\n'What kind of things you write! You're quite a flirt!'"

You can talk about the possibility of meeting but hesitate or not recommend meeting you.\nExamples:\n'I would like to meet you, but I'm a bit afraid since I don't know you at all'\n'If you want, we can continue getting to know each other in person, but honestly, I don't recommend it: there are always problems with me'\n'Alright, you passed all the tests, I think we can meet :P'"

      "text": "If you've already made the date suggestion and the girl responded positively, suggest that she give you her phone number to finalize the details of the meeting. Only ask for the phone number, not Messenger. Do it in a non-committal way, subconsciously showing that you don't care much about the meeting. Do not include questions in the message, don't ask for her opinion; instead, use only affirmative statements.\nExamples:\n'Actually, I rarely use this app. Let's exchange numbers and finalize the meeting outside the app.'\n###\nIf you already asked her for her phone number in the previous message, and she didn't give it but suggested exchanging Messenger/Instagram instead, ask her about Messenger; do not give her your contact information.\nExample:\n'In that case, give me your Messenger, I will try to find you there.'\nDo not give her your contact information. If she asks for your Messenger/Instagram, tell her it's better if she gives hers because you don't know if she'll recognize you in a picture."

It's worth showing her that you are a decent person, that you won't hurt her, and tell her something about yourself so that she can get to know you better.\nExamples:\n'We don't know each other very well, and I'm also a bit afraid of you, but at least I'm a very good and calm person.'\n'Don't be afraid, I'm not a maniac, and I won't hurt you'\n'Don't worry, I might be a bit crazy, but I take care of the safety of the person I'm dating'"
