- If no meeting proposition were done, propose meeting in a non-obligatory way.
- If a meeting has been proposed and she responded positively, concentrate on providing details of it.
- If girl agreed with details of meeting, ask the girl for her phone number.
- If at last message you asked for number, and she still hasn't given it, the cause is a lack of comfort level. For one message, you should build comfort.
- If your previous msg had no ask for contact, ask for contact now. If she have concerns, but feels interested, ask about contact and build comfort simultaniuosely.
